# Privacy Policy – Ark Ahoy!

**Last updated:** 2026-02-13

## 1. Introduction
This Privacy Policy explains how information is processed when you use this mobile game (the “App”).

The App does not require user registration or account creation.

## 2. Data Controller
The developer of the App does not directly collect, store, or process personal data on its own servers.

Any data processing related to advertising or purchases is handled by third-party service providers as described below.

## 3. Advertising
The App displays advertisements using third-party advertising services (currently **Unity Ads**).

These services may process device-related information and advertising identifiers in order to:
- deliver advertisements,
- measure ad performance,
- comply with applicable legal obligations.

The App itself does not access or store this data.

## 4. Personalized and Non-Personalized Ads
When you first use the App, you are asked to choose your advertising preference:

- **Personalized ads**  
  Ads may be tailored based on advertising identifiers and related data, where permitted by law.

- **Non-personalized ads**  
  Ads are shown without personalization and without tracking for advertising purposes.

Your advertising preference affects how ads are delivered (personalized or non-personalized).

Advertisements may be removed entirely through an optional one-time in-app purchase.

You can change your advertising preference at any time in the App’s **Settings / Ad Preferences** menu.

## 5. iOS App Tracking Transparency (ATT)
On iOS devices, if you choose personalized ads, the App may request permission via Apple’s **App Tracking Transparency** framework.

- If permission is granted, advertising identifiers (such as IDFA) may be used by the advertising service.
- If permission is denied, ads will continue to be shown in a non-personalized form.

## 6. In-App Purchases
The App offers optional one-time in-app purchases, such as virtual currency or an option to remove ads.

All payments are processed by the platform provider (Apple App Store or Google Play Store).  
The App does not receive or store payment information.

## 7. Data Sharing
The App does not sell personal data.

Data related to advertising is processed by third-party advertising providers (such as Unity Ads) in accordance with their own privacy policies.

## 8. Children’s Privacy
The App is not intended to knowingly collect personal data from children.

If you believe that personal data has been processed inappropriately, please contact us using the information below.

## 9. Changes to This Privacy Policy
This Privacy Policy may be updated from time to time.  
Any changes will be reflected by updating the “Last updated” date at the top of this document.
